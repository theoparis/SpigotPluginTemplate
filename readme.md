# Creepinson's Spigot Plugin Template for Complete Beginners
**Thank you for using my plugin template! It is free to use in any of your plugins, just please credit me. That's all I request.**  
This template includes an example command, and an example event listener.
This template also includes a few utilities made both by me, and some other programmers out there.

**If you want to add additional libraries to your plugin,
put the dependency information in the pom.yml file in the `<dependencies>` section.
You may need to add the repository to the `<repositories>` section as well.**
